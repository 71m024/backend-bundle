Installation
============

Make sure Composer is installed globally, as explained in the
[installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
of the Composer documentation.

Applications that use Symfony Flex
----------------------------------

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute:

```console
composer require <package-name>
```

Applications that don't use Symfony Flex
----------------------------------------

### Step 1: Download the Bundle

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

```console
composer require <package-name>
```

### Step 2: Enable the Bundle

Then, enable the bundle by adding it to the list of registered bundles
in the `config/bundles.php` file of your project:

```php
// config/bundles.php

return [
    // ...
    <vendor>\<bundle-name>\<bundle-long-name>::class => ['all' => true],
];
```

### Configuration
This is an example configuration:

```yaml
# config/packages/backend.yml

backend:
    resized_image_provider:
        max_heights: [50, 100, 150, 200]
        media_object_class: 'App\Entity\MediaObject'
```

Your MediaObject must implement the `TimbleOne\BackendBundle\MediaObject` interface.
